The topic of my research is the risk assessment of malaria in China during the malaria elimination phase.
Knowledge needed involves comprehensive evaluation methods, structural equation modelling(SEM), analytic hierarchy process(AHP) and so on.
I put my ideas in OneNote and technical knowledge in github to assist myself and people like me while using these methods.

## methods
### [SEM](/methods/sem/)
structual equation modeling
