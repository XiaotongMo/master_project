The topic of my research is the risk assessment of malaria in China during the malaria elimination phase.
Knowledge needed involves comprehensive evaluation methods, structural equation modelling(SEM), analytic hierarchy process(AHP) and so on.
I put my ideas in OneNote and technical knowledge in github to assist myself and people like me while using these methods.

## how to assess risk?   [methods](/methods/)
### SEM, structual equation modeling
I regard SEM and ISM as the same. 
- SEM is an abbreviation for structral equation modeling.
- ISM is for inpreting structral modeling.
