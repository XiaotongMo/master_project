# Zotero is really a very useful manager of documents!

Many classmates of mine have heard about how Zotero is convenient as I often share some small tips of Zotero. People choose what is good for them and I am not here to look down on any tool other than Z. Every tool has its own master at a proper time. 

I want to back up my files of different kinds including websites and pdf docs and MSword docs immediately, mark everything I think usable when surfing the Internet quickly, use it in an official way, and, what's the most important, wait little time to start it! 

What I don't need is the part aimed for bibliometrics including some information of attributes extracted from papers.

Therefore, Z is favorable for me.


## Here is to record some tips of usages of Zotero!

## Zotero extension/add-on in Chrome/Firefox browser
U have to install it. Really helpful!

## (for managing Chinese papers 给中文文献依赖者) 请导入CNKI、万方、百度学术的translator（“题录识别器”？）
If U rely on Chinese papers to finish your work, these three translators are essential, very essential.
